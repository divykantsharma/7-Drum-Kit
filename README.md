# 7-Drum-Kit
Made this project with the help of JavaScript and using the DOM model and included sound and animations in the project. Here the sounds are produced either if we click the icons on the screen or if we tap those keys on the keyboard.

A drum kit webpage which allows users to play different drum sounds by clicking on buttons or pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard.

Here's an overview of how the code works:
1. The script first selects all elements with the class "drum" and stores them in a NodeList called numberOfDrumButtons.
2. A loop is then used to iterate over each drum button in numberOfDrumButtons.
3. For each drum button, an event listener is added to detect the "click" event. When a drum button is clicked, the makeSound function is called with the inner HTML of the clicked button as an argument, and the buttonAnimation function is also called with the same argument.
4. Another event listener is added to the entire document to detect the "keydown" event. When a key is pressed, the makeSound function is called with the pressed key as an argument, and the buttonAnimation function is also called with the same argument.
5. The makeSound function takes the key as a parameter and uses a switch statement to determine which sound to play based on the key.
6. Each case in the switch statement corresponds to a specific key ("w", "a", "s", etc.) and creates a new Audio object with the corresponding sound file path. The sound is then played using the play method of the Audio object.
7. The buttonAnimation function is called to add a visual effect to the drum button or key that was pressed. It adds the class "pressed" to the corresponding button element, which triggers a CSS animation. After a short delay (100 milliseconds), the "pressed" class is removed, causing the animation to end.

-> Overall, this code allows users to interact with the drum kit webpage by clicking on buttons or pressing keys, producing different drum sounds and visual effects in response.
